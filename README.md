# Abstract
This paper proposes an extension to the p-median model to support the allocation of facilities requiring the spatial distribution of supply to be considered simultaneously with demand. Using a bioenergy case study in Scotland, it allocates combined heat and power (CHP) units of different sizes (capacities), requiring different amounts of land based feedstock, accounting for the resources needed to supply facilities at any given location, as well as the spatial distribution of demand. The context of this work is the increase in community renewable energy initiatives and the associated land reform agendas in Scotland. The results indicate how a predefined mix of facilities of different capacities can be located relative to biomass supply and household demand, and how an optimal mix of facilities can be determined and located to satisfy to achieve a specific bioenergy generation target. A number of key considerations are discussed including the nature of the evaluation function which evaluates measures of demand and measures of supply simultaneously and not just their locations. This is especially important if this approach is used to locate facilities as well allocate land for multiple land uses.
